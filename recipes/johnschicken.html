    <h1>Chef John's 20 Greatest Grilled Chicken Recipes</h1>
    <img src="RecipeSiteProject/images/johnschicken.jpg" alt="Johns Paprika Chicken">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This grilled chicken recipe is quite simple, but the vinaigrette added at the end was a spontaneous addition that turned out wonderfully. I really enjoy oil and vinegar-based sauces on grilled meats; they complement the smoky, caramelized exterior perfectly.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ground paprika</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot chile paste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 (5 pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive olive</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon hot chile paste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together yogurt, garlic, 3 tablespoons paprika, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon hot chile paste, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. </li>
        <li>Mix in chicken pieces and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours. </li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. </li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the bag and transfer to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Pat chicken pieces dry with more paper towels. Season with salt. </li>
        <li>Combine 1/4 cup olive oil, sherry vinegar, ketchup, 1/8 teaspoon hot chile paste, pinch paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Set aside. </li>
        <li>Grill chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill for 4 minutes with grill lid closed. </li>
        <li>Turn chicken and grill with lid closed until well-browned and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Spoon sherry vinegar mixture over cooked chicken and serve. </li>
    </ol>
